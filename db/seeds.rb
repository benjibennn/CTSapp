# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user = {}
# user['password'] = 'asdf'

#     user['first_name'] = "John" 
#     user['last_name'] = "Doe"
#     user['email'] = "john@email.com"
#     user['gender'] = "male"
#     user['phone'] = "0123456789"
#     user['role'] = 'admin'

#     User.create(user)
